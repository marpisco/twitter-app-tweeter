Post using the Twitter API to show a different label.

# WARNING
This application no longer functions properly, due to the X (formely Twitter) API having changed.

The API now requires you to pay (or to have limited Tweets?), and it's not even worth it anymore due to them actually removing the Label.

The entire gimmick of this project was to change the "Twitter for Android, Web App, etc..." label from the tweet. They've ruined it.

## How to install?
The only requirement is `tweepy`. Using the command `pip3 install tweepy`, you'll have all the requirements (and in theory) should be able to go!

## License
This repository and work are licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**. You can read the license and research about it.

## Warranty
I'm not planning on updating this **at all**. I'm pretty sure this is the final commit for it.

All the API for X (formely Twitter) has been changed, and it's not worth it to update anymore.

## Credits
Nobody else other than me worked on this project. If you'd like to continue on this project (and make it look nicer or actually MAKE IT WORK), fork this and continue to update this yourself.

In the meanwhile, the project will stay **permanently archived**.
